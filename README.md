# AlphaPulse-AI
AlphaPulse AI captures the market's emotional pulse from news and social media in real-time, converting qualitative sentiment into a quantitative, automated trading edge for cryptocurrencies.

#Vision
AlphaPulse AI solves the critical problem of market latency in reacting to qualitative information. While quantitative data is instantly priced in by algorithms, the market's emotional pulse—driven by news, influencer commentary, and social media frenzy—creates a short-lived but exploitable informational edge. Our project captures this edge by processing unstructured text data in real-time, translating the chaos of social sentiment into a clear, actionable, and automated trading signal before the broader market can fully react.
